## Volcanoes National Park

> $15 entry fee for this park, make sure to get $25 Hawaii Tri-Park Pass if also planning to visit Haleakala in Maui http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/havo\/planyourvisit\/fees.htm

Easy 2-3 hr. drive from Kona, highly recommended. Conditions are constantly changing and of the three active volcanoes and one dormant volcano, any of them could be having an eruption. Interesting fact, the volcanoes here usually just dribble lava down the sides of the gentle mountains as opposed to shooting up in the sky. Awesome park ranger talk, eating at Volcano house recommended \(really small portions though\) and going to the Thurston lava tube and Jaggar museum\/viewpoint, especially at night.
