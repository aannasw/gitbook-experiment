## Mauna Kea Summit

Only 4x4 allowed past the visitor center because of 4 miles of unpaved gravel road. Star-gazing tours are available but sell out well in advance â€“ so book now. You could hitch a ride with someone to go up past the visitor center and back \(we did\), but rides back down are not guaranteed. None of the buildings up there are open to the public, so only thing you can do is enjoy the view at 14,000 feet and walk around.
