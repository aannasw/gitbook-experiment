## Thunder Mountain Coffee Plantation and Mill

Rated crazy high on TripAdvisor and totally worth the hype. Barely 15 mins from Kona downtown, it's up on a mountain in a "cloud forest" and they grow, harvest, mill, roast and sell their organically made coffee. There's overview tours everyday \(don't know the exact schedule, but we lucked into a tour at 1 pm\) and they show you all the stages of the coffee cherry to bean and how they roast and why Starbucks sucks. Very informative and it's gorgeous up there. And free coffee samples! And their chocolate-covered coffee bean is life changing.
